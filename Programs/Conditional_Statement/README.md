This folder contains some practice assignment questions regarding conditional statements.

**Conditional Statements** in programming are constructs that control the flow of execution based on certain conditions:

- **Purpose**: They enable the program to make decisions and execute different blocks of code depending on whether conditions are true or false.
- **Types**:
- 
  - **if Statement**: Executes a block of code if the condition is true.
  - 
  - **if-else Statement**: Executes one block of code if the condition is true and another if it is false.
  - 
  - **if-elif-else Statement**: Tests multiple conditions in sequence and executes the corresponding block for the first true condition.
  - 
- **Usage**: Essential for implementing decision-making and complex logic in programs, allowing for dynamic behavior based on varying conditions.
