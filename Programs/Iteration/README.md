This folder contains the questions regarding the loops.

**Iteration** in programming refers to the process of repeatedly executing a block of code:

- **Purpose**: Enables the automation of repetitive tasks and processing of collections or sequences of data efficiently.

- **Types**:
  
  - **For Loop**: Iterates over a sequence (e.g., list, tuple) or range, executing the code block for each item.
    
  - **While Loop**: Continues executing as long as a specified condition remains true, useful for dynamic or unknown iteration counts.
    
- **Control Variables**: Variables that manage the iteration process, such as counters or indices.
 
- **Termination**: Includes a condition or mechanism to stop the loop and avoid infinite execution.
  
- **Usage**: Crucial for tasks like traversing data structures, performing repetitive operations, and automating workflows.
