**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python** is a paradigm that structures programs using objects and classes to encapsulate data and behavior. Python supports key OOP concepts such as:

- **Encapsulation**: Combining data and methods into a single class, allowing controlled access and modification.
  
- **Abstraction**: Simplifying complex systems by exposing only essential elements and hiding internal details.
  
- **Inheritance**: Creating new classes based on existing ones to promote code reuse and establish a hierarchical relationship.
  
- **Polymorphism**: Allowing different classes to be treated as instances of a common superclass, enabling a unified interface for diverse implementations.

These principles enhance code modularity, readability, and maintainability, making Python a powerful language for OOP.
