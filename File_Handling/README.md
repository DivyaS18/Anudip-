File handling in Python is a crucial aspect of programming that involves reading from and writing to files stored on a computer. It allows developers to persist data beyond the runtime of 
a program, making it possible to save, retrieve, and manipulate data across different sessions. Python provides built-in functions like **open()**, **read()**, **write()**, and **close()** to 
facilitate these operations. Files can be handled in various modes, such as read (r), write (w), append (a), and binary (b) modes, offering flexibility in how data is managed. Proper file 
handling ensures data integrity and helps in managing resources efficiently, such as closing files after operations to free up system resources.
