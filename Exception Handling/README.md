Exception handling in Python is a mechanism to manage errors gracefully during program execution. It involves using `try` and `except` blocks to catch and handle exceptions that occur, 
preventing the program from crashing. The `try` block contains the code that might raise an exception, while the `except` block handles the exception if it occurs. Python also provides 
`else` and `finally` blocks for code that should run if no exception is raised or for cleanup actions, respectively. This approach ensures that programs can handle unexpected situations 
robustly, improving reliability and user experience.
