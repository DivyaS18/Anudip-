This folder contains different collection datatypes of python and operations performed on it:

**Tuple in Python**

A tuple is a data type in Python that is used to store multiple items in a single variable. It is ordered, immutable, and allows duplicateelements.

**Key Characteristics of Tuples**
**Ordered**: The elements in a tuple have a defined order, and that order will not change.
**Immutable**: Once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed, added, or removed.
**Allows Duplicates**: A tuple can contain multiple elements with the same value.

**List of Operations That Can Be Performed on Tuples:**
Creating Tuples, Accessing Elements, Slicing, Concatenation, Repetition, Iteration, Length, Count, Indexing, Reversing, Converting

**List in Python**

A list is a mutable, ordered collection of items. Lists can store elements of different data types and are defined using square brackets [].

**Key Characteristics of Lists**
**Ordered**: Elements in a list maintain a specific order.
**Mutable**: Elements can be changed, added, or removed.
**Allows Duplicates**: Lists can contain multiple elements with the same value.
**Heterogeneous**: Lists can store elements of different data types.

**List of Operations That Can Be Performed on Lists:**
Creation, Traversal, Insertion, Deletion, Sorting, Searching, Length, Concatenation, Updation, Slicing, Indexing, Converting etc..

**Dictionary in Python**

A dictionary is an unordered, mutable collection of key-value pairs. Each key in a dictionary is unique and is used to access the corresponding value.

**Key Characteristics of Dictionaries**
**Unordered**: The order of elements in a dictionary is not maintained.
**Mutable**: The contents of a dictionary can be changed.
**Key-Value Pairs**: Each element is a key-value pair.
**Unique Keys**: Each key in a dictionary must be unique.
**Heterogeneous**: Keys and values can be of different data types.

**List of Operations That Can Be Performed on Dictionaries:**
Creation, Traversal, Insertion, Deletion, Sorting, Searching, Length, Concatenation, Updation, Slicing, Indexing, Converting, Getting Keys
Getting Values, Getting Items (key-value pairs), Copying, Merging,
