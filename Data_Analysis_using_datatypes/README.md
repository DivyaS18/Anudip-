Data analysis using Python leverages various data types to efficiently handle and interpret data. **Lists** and **tuples** are used to store 
sequences of data, with lists allowing for mutable operations and tuples providing immutability for fixed datasets. **Dictionaries** offer a 
flexible way to store and retrieve data via key-value pairs, ideal for managing labeled data and performing lookups. These data types enable 
analysts to clean, manipulate, and analyze data effectively. In addition, network analysis tools like `tracert` (trace route) can be 
integrated to monitor and map the path data takes through networks, complementing Python's data processing capabilities. By utilizing 
libraries like pandas and NumPy, Python enhances its data handling capabilities, allowing for complex operations and insights derived from 
diverse datasets.
