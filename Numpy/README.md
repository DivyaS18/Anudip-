NumPy, short for Numerical Python, is a fundamental library for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. NumPy's core feature is its ndarray object, which enables efficient storage and manipulation of numerical data. It offers a wide range of operations, including element-wise arithmetic, statistical analysis, linear algebra operations, and more. NumPy is widely used in scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning, serving as the foundation for many other scientific libraries in Python. Its efficient performance and extensive functionality make it an essential tool for data scientists and engineers.

**Array Creation**

**numpy.array()**: Create an array from a list or tuple.

**numpy.zeros()**: Create an array filled with zeros.

**numpy.ones()**: Create an array filled with ones.

**numpy.eye()**: Create an identity matrix.

**Array Operations**

**numpy.reshape()**: Change the shape of an array without changing its data.

**Random Number Generation**

**numpy.random.rand()**: Generate an array of random numbers from a uniform distribution.

**numpy.random.randint()**: Generate random integers.

**Other Functions**

Here's a list of common NumPy functions for summation, minimum, maximum, and cumulative operations:

1. **np.sum()**
2. **np.min()**
3. **np.max()**
4. **np.cumsum()**
5. **np.argmin()**
6. **np.argmax()**
7. **np.unique()**
